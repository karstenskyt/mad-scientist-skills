# Linguistic Rules Reference

## Purpose

Answer: "Does every sentence earn its place?"

This reference provides grep-testable patterns for common linguistic anti-patterns in technical documentation. Rules are drawn from three authoritative sources:

1. **Strunk & White** — *The Elements of Style* (rules of composition and word usage)
2. **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide** — audience-focused technical writing standards
3. **Microsoft Writing Style Guide** — tone, inclusivity, and globalization standards

Each rule includes a regex pattern for automated detection, an example violation, and its corrected form. Rules marked "requires manual check" need human judgment; the regex serves only as a heuristic signal.

- **Corrected:** "To deploy, run the script." / "Because the server crashed..."
- **Exception:** Legal or compliance text where exact phrasing is mandated.

### Rule 15 — Use Parallel Construction

- **Pattern:** Detect list items mixing verb forms (requires manual check) — look for lists where items alternate between gerunds (`-ing`), infinitives (`to + verb`), and bare imperatives
- **Violation:** "The system handles: logging errors, to retry failed requests, and validates input."
- **Corrected:** "The system handles: logging errors, retrying failed requests, and validating input."
- **Exception:** Mixed-form lists that are direct quotations from external specifications.

- **Corrected:** "Add the IP to the allowlist."

### Sentence Length

- **Pattern:** Count words per sentence (automated: split on `[.!?]`, count tokens > 26)
- **Violation:** "The configuration file that is located in the root directory of the project and is used by the build system to determine which modules to include must be updated before deploying." (33 words)
- **Corrected:** "The build system reads the configuration file from the project root directory. Update this file before deploying to specify which modules to include."

### Descriptive Link Text

- **Pattern:** `\[(click here|here|this page|this link|this article|link|read more)\]`
- **Violation:** "For details, see [this page](url)."
- **Corrected:** "For details, see [Configuring TLS](url)."

### Meaningful Alt Text

- **Pattern (empty):** `!\[\s*\]\(` — empty alt text
- **Pattern (generic):** `!\[(image|screenshot|picture|photo|icon)\]\(` — generic alt text

## Microsoft Writing Style Guide Rules

### Contractions Are OK

- **Pattern:** `\b(do not|does not|is not|are not|was not|were not|will not|cannot|could not|should not|would not|have not|has not|had not)\b` — flag for possible contraction
- **How it differs from Google:** Google permits but does not encourage contractions; Microsoft actively recommends them.

### UI Terminology

- **Pattern:** `\b(click on|hit|punch|push)\b` (when describing UI interaction)
- **How it differs from Google:** Google uses "click" broadly; Microsoft distinguishes "select" (for options/checkboxes) from "enter" (for text input).

### Bias-Free Communication

- **Pattern:** `\b(normal\s+user|crazy|insane|lame|crippled|blind\s+to|deaf\s+to|dumb\s+terminal)\b`
- **How it differs from Google:** Microsoft provides more detailed guidance on disability-related language than Google.

### Global-Ready Writing

- **Pattern:** `\b(out of the box|under the hood|at the end of the day|low-hanging fruit|boil the ocean|move the needle|circle back|deep dive|best of breed|apples? to (apples?|oranges?))\b`
- **How it differs from Google:** Google mentions localization; Microsoft provides a comprehensive global-ready checklist.

### Oxford Comma Required

- **Pattern:** `\b\w+,\s+\w+\s+(and|or)\s+\w+\b` — list of 3+ items without Oxford comma (requires manual verification of missing comma before conjunction)
- **How it differs from Google:** Google also requires the Oxford comma; Microsoft explicitly mandates it in all contexts including UI strings.

## Permitted Exceptions

When rules may be intentionally violated — each exception must be documented with the rationale in the audit report.

- **Passive voice is permitted when:**
  - Emphasizing the object over the actor: "The configuration file is loaded at startup" — the file matters more than the loader
  - The actor is genuinely unknown or irrelevant: "The vulnerability was discovered in 2019"
  - Avoiding blaming the user: "50 merge conflicts were found" is preferable to "You created 50 merge conflicts"
  - Describing system behavior from the user's perspective: "Your request is being processed"

- **"currently" is permitted when:**
  - Describing a known temporary state that is documented as temporary and has a linked tracking issue (e.g., "The API currently returns XML — see #1234 for JSON migration")
  - The word is removed once the temporary state resolves

- **Code identifiers are exempt from inclusive language rules when:**
  - The term appears in code-font (backticks) and references an actual identifier in source code that uses the legacy term: `` `master` branch in the `legacy-auth` repository``
  - Prose surrounding the code reference must use the inclusive alternative: "the primary branch (`master`) in the legacy-auth repository"
  - New code and new documentation must always use inclusive terms

- **Quotations are exempt when:**
  - Quoting external sources, specifications, or error messages that use non-inclusive language
  - The quotation is clearly attributed and set apart (blockquote or inline quotes)
  - Commentary surrounding the quotation uses inclusive language

- **Vague quantifiers ("several", "various") are permitted when:**
  - Immediately followed by a specific enumeration: "Several factors affect latency: network round-trip time, serialization overhead, and queue depth"
  - The exact count is genuinely unknown and an approximation is more honest than a fabricated number

- **Sentence length may exceed 26 words when:**
  - The sentence contains a code example or command that cannot be broken without losing clarity
  - The sentence is a single list introduced by a colon (the list items add length but not complexity)
