# Pipeline & Data Observability Reference

End-to-end observability guide for data pipelines covering health signals, orchestrator-specific monitoring, data quality gates, freshness tracking, volume anomaly detection, and pipeline tracing with OpenTelemetry.

## Purpose

Answer: "Can we detect pipeline failures, data quality issues, and freshness problems before they impact downstream consumers?"

## Checklist

Before auditing, identify:

- [ ] Which orchestrator is used (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, dbt Cloud, cron)
- [ ] Which data stores are involved (warehouse, lake, object storage, streaming)
- [ ] Which data testing framework is in place (dbt tests, Great Expectations, Soda, custom)
- [ ] What alerting and notification channels exist (PagerDuty, Slack, email, OpsGenie)
- [ ] Whether an observability backend is deployed (Datadog, Grafana, New Relic, OpenTelemetry Collector)
- [ ] What SLAs or SLOs exist for data freshness and pipeline completion

## Pipeline Health Signals

| Signal | What to measure | Why it matters | Alert threshold example |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Execution duration | Wall-clock time per pipeline run | Detect regressions, resource contention | >2x median of last 14 days |
| Success/failure rate | Pass/fail ratio over rolling window | Spot reliability degradation | <95% over 24h |
| Row counts per stage | Rows read, transformed, written at each step | Catch silent data loss or duplication | >30% deviation from baseline |
| Data freshness | Time since last successful load per table | Detect stale data before consumers notice | Exceeds SLA (e.g., >2h for hourly) |
| Schema drift | Column additions, removals, type changes | Prevent downstream breakage | Any unexpected change |
| Resource usage | CPU, memory, I/O, query slots consumed | Capacity planning, cost control | >80% sustained utilization |
| Retry count | Number of automatic retries per task | Flaky tasks masking real failures | >2 retries per run |
| Queue/backlog depth | Pending runs or tasks waiting to execute | Detect scheduling bottlenecks | Growing backlog over 3+ intervals |

---

## dbt Observability

### Parsing `run_results.json`

After every `dbt run` or `dbt test`, dbt writes results to `target/run_results.json`. Parse this file to extract per-model execution time, test pass/fail counts, and failure details.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

def parse_run_results(path="target/run_results.json"):
    data = json.loads(Path(path).read_text())
    models, tests_passed, tests_failed, failures = [], 0, 0, []
    for r in data["results"]:
        node = r["unique_id"]
        status = r["status"]
        elapsed = r.get("execution_time", 0)
        if node.startswith("model."):
            models.append({"model": node, "status": status, "seconds": round(elapsed, 2)})
        elif node.startswith("test."):
            if status == "pass":
                tests_passed += 1
            else:
                tests_failed += 1
                failures.append({"test": node, "status": status, "message": r.get("message", "")})
    print(f"Models: {len(models)} | Tests passed: {tests_passed} | Tests failed: {tests_failed}")
    for m in sorted(models, key=lambda x: x["seconds"], reverse=True)[:5]:
        print(f"  {m['model']}: {m['seconds']}s ({m['status']})")
    for f in failures:
        print(f"  FAIL: {f['test']} — {f['message'][:120]}")
    return {"models": models, "tests_passed": tests_passed, "tests_failed": tests_failed, "failures": failures}
```

### Source Freshness Configuration

Define freshness thresholds in `sources.yml` so `dbt source freshness` can detect stale upstream data before running transformations.

```yaml
# models/staging/sources.yml
version: 2
sources:
  - name: raw_payments
    database: analytics
    schema: raw
    loaded_at_field: _loaded_at
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 2, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
    tables:
      - name: transactions
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 1, period: hour}
          error_after: {count: 3, period: hour}
      - name: refunds
      - name: customers
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
          error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
```

Run freshness checks as a CI gate:

```bash
dbt source freshness --select source:raw_payments
# Exit code 1 if any source exceeds error_after threshold
```

### dbt Test Result Tracking

Track test results over time to detect flaky tests and quality regressions:

| Pattern | How | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Store test results | `dbt test --store-failures` | Write failing rows to the warehouse for investigation |
| Severity levels | `severity: warn` vs `severity: error` | Non-blocking vs blocking failures |
| Custom generic tests | `tests/generic/` directory | Reusable domain-specific validations |
| Test selection | `dbt test --select tag:critical` | Run critical tests first, fast feedback |
| CI integration | Fail PR if `dbt test` exits non-zero | Prevent merging data quality regressions |

### dbt Fusion Native OTLP (Preview)

dbt Fusion (the Rust-based dbt runtime) includes native OpenTelemetry trace export. When available, this will emit spans for each model and test execution without custom instrumentation. This is currently in preview — track the dbt Fusion release notes for GA availability. Consider it a future option rather than a production-ready solution today.

---

## Airflow Observability

### Task-Level Callbacks

Use `on_failure_callback` and `on_success_callback` to send structured alerts on task completion:

```python
from airflow.models import TaskInstance

def on_failure_alert(context: dict):
    ti: TaskInstance = context["task_instance"]
    dag_id = ti.dag_id
    task_id = ti.task_id
    execution_date = context["execution_date"]
    exception = context.get("exception", "unknown")
    # Send to Slack, PagerDuty, or custom webhook
    payload = {
        "dag": dag_id,
        "task": task_id,
        "execution_date": str(execution_date),
        "error": str(exception)[:500],
        "log_url": ti.log_url,
    }
    send_alert(payload)  # your alerting function

# Apply at DAG level (inherited by all tasks)
with DAG(
    "my_pipeline",
    default_args={"on_failure_callback": on_failure_alert},
    # ...
) as dag:
    pass
```

### DAG and Task Instance Metrics

| Metric | Source | What to monitor |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| DAG run duration | `dag_run` table / StatsD | Trend over time, detect regressions |
| Task duration | `task_instance` table / StatsD | Per-task execution time |
| Task retries | `task_instance.try_number` | Flaky tasks retrying frequently |
| SLA misses | `sla_miss` table | Tasks exceeding defined SLAs |
| Pool slot usage | Pool configuration | Detect resource contention |
| Scheduler heartbeat | `scheduler_heartbeat` | Scheduler health |
| DAG bag parse time | StatsD `dag_processing.total_parse_time` | Slow parsing blocks scheduling |

### SLA Misses

```python
with DAG("my_pipeline", default_args={"sla": timedelta(hours=2)}):
    # Tasks that exceed 2 hours from the DAG run's execution_date
    # will generate SLA miss records
    extract = PythonOperator(task_id="extract", python_callable=extract_fn, sla=timedelta(minutes=30))
```

### Airflow + OpenTelemetry

Airflow 2.7+ supports native OpenTelemetry integration:

```ini
# airflow.cfg
[traces]
otel_on = True
otel_host = otel-collector
otel_port = 4318
otel_ssl_active = False
```

This emits spans per task instance, enabling distributed tracing across DAG runs.

## Dagster / Prefect Observability

### Dagster

| Feature | What it provides | Observability value |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Asset materialization events | Timestamp + metadata per asset update | Data freshness, lineage |
| Asset observations | Check external state without materializing | Freshness without re-running |
| Run status sensors | React to run success/failure programmatically | Custom alerting, downstream triggers |
| Built-in Dagster UI | Timeline, asset graph, run history | Visual debugging |
| Dagster+ (Cloud) | Alerts, insights, cost tracking | Managed observability |

```python
from dagster import asset, AssetObservation, Output

@asset
def orders(context):
    df = load_orders()
    context.log_event(
        AssetObservation(
            asset_key="orders",
            metadata={"row_count": len(df), "max_order_date": str(df["order_date"].max())},
        )
    )
    return Output(df, metadata={"row_count": len(df)})
```

### Prefect

| Feature | What it provides | Observability value |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Flow run states | Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled | Lifecycle tracking |
| Task run states | Same granularity at task level | Pinpoint failures |
| Automations | Trigger actions on state changes | Alerting, remediation |
| Artifacts | Publish markdown, tables, links from flows | Rich run metadata |
| Events | Structured event stream for all activity | Audit trail, custom dashboards |

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.artifacts import create_markdown_artifact

@task
def validate_output(df):
    row_count = len(df)
    create_markdown_artifact(
        key="validation-report",
        markdown=f"## Validation\n- Row count: {row_count}\n- Null rate: {df.isnull().mean().max():.2%}",
    )
    if row_count == 0:
        raise ValueError("Zero rows produced — aborting pipeline")
```

### Sensor-Based Health Checks

Both Dagster and Prefect support sensor patterns that poll external systems and trigger pipelines or alerts:

```python
# Dagster sensor example
from dagster import sensor, RunRequest, SkipReason

@sensor(job=my_job, minimum_interval_seconds=300)
def source_freshness_sensor(context):
    last_modified = check_source_table_freshness("raw.events")
    if last_modified > timedelta(hours=1):
        return SkipReason(f"Source data is {last_modified} old — waiting for refresh")
    return RunRequest(run_key=f"events-{last_modified}")
```

---

## Data Quality Gates

### Pre/Post-Load Validation Patterns

| Stage | Validation | Action on failure |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Pre-load (source) | Schema matches expected, file is non-empty, freshness OK | Skip load, alert |
| Mid-pipeline | Row counts within bounds, no unexpected nulls | Halt pipeline, alert |
| Post-load (target) | Primary keys unique, referential integrity intact, row count delta OK | Quarantine bad data, alert |
| Post-publish | Dashboard queries return data, API responses valid | Rollback, alert |

### Great Expectations Integration

```python
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context()
batch = context.sources.pandas_default.read_csv("output.csv")
results = batch.validate(
    expectation_suite="orders_suite",
    # Expectations defined in suite:
    # - expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("order_id")
    # - expect_column_values_to_be_unique("order_id")
    # - expect_column_values_to_be_in_set("status", ["pending", "shipped", "delivered", "cancelled"])
    # - expect_table_row_count_to_be_between(min_value=1000, max_value=500000)
)
if not results.success:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Data quality check failed: {results.statistics}")
```

### dbt Test Patterns

| Test type | YAML example | What it catches |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `not_null` | `- not_null: {column_name: order_id}` | Missing required values |
| `unique` | `- unique: {column_name: order_id}` | Duplicate records |
| `accepted_values` | `- accepted_values: {column_name: status, values: ['active','inactive']}` | Invalid enum values |
| `relationships` | `- relationships: {to: ref('customers'), field: customer_id}` | Broken foreign keys |
| Custom SQL | `tests/assert_positive_revenue.sql` | Domain-specific invariants |

Custom SQL test example:

```sql
-- tests/assert_no_negative_revenue.sql
-- This test fails if any rows are returned
select order_id, revenue
from {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
where revenue < 0
```

---

## Dead Letter Pattern

Quarantine failed records instead of dropping them silently or halting the entire pipeline.

| Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Dead letter table/queue | Store records that failed validation or transformation | Dedicated table with error metadata |
| Error metadata | Understand why the record failed | Error reason, timestamp, source record ID, pipeline run ID |
| Monitoring | Detect quality degradation | Alert when dead letter rate exceeds threshold |
| Reprocessing | Fix and replay failed records | Periodic job to retry or manual review |

```sql
-- Dead letter table schema
CREATE TABLE dead_letter_orders (
    dl_id           BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    source_record_id TEXT,
    error_reason    TEXT,
    failed_at       TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    pipeline_run_id TEXT,
    raw_payload     JSONB,
    reprocessed     BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Insert failed records during transformation
INSERT INTO dead_letter_orders (source_record_id, error_reason, pipeline_run_id, raw_payload)
SELECT
    order_id,
    CASE
        WHEN amount IS NULL THEN 'null_amount'
        WHEN amount < 0 THEN 'negative_amount'
        WHEN customer_id IS NULL THEN 'null_customer'
    END,
    '{{ run_id }}',
    to_jsonb(t.*)
FROM staging_orders t
WHERE amount IS NULL OR amount < 0 OR customer_id IS NULL;
```

**Dead letter volume alerting:**

```sql
-- Alert query: dead letter rate over last hour
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS dead_letter_count,
    COUNT(*)::FLOAT / NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_orders WHERE loaded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'), 0) AS dead_letter_rate
FROM dead_letter_orders
WHERE failed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Alert if dead_letter_rate > 0.05 (5%)
```

---

## Data Freshness Monitoring

### Staleness Thresholds

Define freshness SLIs per table based on how frequently the source updates and how tolerant consumers are of stale data:

| Table | Update frequency | Warn threshold | Error threshold | Consumer impact |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `fct_orders` | Hourly | 2 hours | 4 hours | Dashboards show stale revenue |
| `dim_customers` | Daily | 26 hours | 48 hours | Customer segments outdated |
| `fct_events` | Real-time/micro-batch | 15 minutes | 1 hour | Alerting and anomaly detection delayed |
| `dim_products` | Weekly | 8 days | 14 days | Product catalog stale |

### Freshness Check Query

```sql
-- Generic freshness check: find tables that exceed their SLA
WITH freshness_sla AS (
    SELECT 'fct_orders'    AS table_name, INTERVAL '4 hour'  AS max_staleness
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'dim_customers' AS table_name, INTERVAL '48 hour' AS max_staleness
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'fct_events'    AS table_name, INTERVAL '1 hour'  AS max_staleness
),
actual_freshness AS (
    SELECT 'fct_orders'    AS table_name, MAX(updated_at) AS last_updated FROM fct_orders
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'dim_customers' AS table_name, MAX(updated_at) AS last_updated FROM dim_customers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'fct_events'    AS table_name, MAX(event_time) AS last_updated FROM fct_events
)
SELECT
    s.table_name,
    a.last_updated,
    NOW() - a.last_updated AS staleness,
    s.max_staleness,
    CASE WHEN NOW() - a.last_updated > s.max_staleness THEN 'STALE' ELSE 'OK' END AS status
FROM freshness_sla s
JOIN actual_freshness a ON s.table_name = a.table_name
ORDER BY staleness DESC;
```

### Freshness SLIs

Track freshness as an SLI (Service Level Indicator) and set SLOs:

- **SLI:** Percentage of checks where `staleness < max_staleness`
- **SLO:** 99.5% of freshness checks pass over a 30-day window
- **Error budget:** ~3.6 hours of allowed staleness violations per month

---

## Data Volume Anomaly Detection

### Statistical Baseline

Compare current row counts against a rolling baseline to detect unexpected drops, spikes, or zero-row loads:

```python
import json
from statistics import mean, stdev

def check_volume_anomaly(current_count: int, historical_counts: list[int], z_threshold: float = 3.0):
    """Flag anomalies using Z-score against historical baseline."""
    if len(historical_counts) < 7:
        print("Not enough history for anomaly detection — skipping")
        return False
    if current_count == 0:
        print("ALERT: Zero rows detected — pipeline may have produced no output")
        return True
    mu = mean(historical_counts)
    sigma = stdev(historical_counts)
    if sigma == 0:
        return current_count != mu
    z_score = (current_count - mu) / sigma
    is_anomaly = abs(z_score) > z_threshold
    if is_anomaly:
        direction = "above" if z_score > 0 else "below"
        print(f"ALERT: Row count {current_count} is {abs(z_score):.1f} std devs {direction} mean ({mu:.0f})")
    return is_anomaly
```

### Alerting Strategies

| Condition | Detection method | Severity |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Zero rows produced | `count == 0` | Critical |
| Row count drop >50% | Percentage deviation from prior run | High |
| Row count Z-score >3 | Statistical outlier vs rolling 14-day baseline | High |
| Row count Z-score >2 | Moderate deviation | Warning |
| Monotonically increasing table shrinks | Current max(id) < previous max(id) | High |

---

## Idempotency Verification

Pipelines must be safe to re-run without producing duplicates or corrupting state.

### Re-Run Safety Patterns

| Pattern | How it works | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `MERGE` / upsert | Match on key, update existing, insert new | Slowly changing dimensions, event dedup |
| `replaceWhere` (Delta/Spark) | Overwrite only the affected partition | Partition-scoped incremental loads |
| `DELETE + INSERT` | Delete target partition, then insert | Simple partition replacement |
| `INSERT OVERWRITE` | Atomic partition replacement | Hive-style partitioned tables |
| Dedup on write | `SELECT DISTINCT` or `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER()` before insert | Any pattern — defense in depth |

### Detecting Duplicates

```sql
-- Find duplicate primary keys in a target table
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM fct_orders
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Detect duplicates introduced by a specific pipeline run
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM fct_orders
WHERE _loaded_at >= '{{ run_start }}'
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Idempotency Verification Query

```sql
-- Run the pipeline twice, then compare: counts should be identical
-- Before re-run
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM fct_orders WHERE order_date = '2025-01-15';
-- After re-run (should match exactly)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM fct_orders WHERE order_date = '2025-01-15';
```

## Pipeline-as-OTel-Traces

Model each pipeline run as a single distributed trace with child spans per task or stage. This gives end-to-end visibility into pipeline execution in any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend (Jaeger, Tempo, Datadog, Honeycomb).

### Concept

```
Pipeline Run (parent span)
├── Extract: source_a (child span, 45s)
├── Extract: source_b (child span, 30s)
├── Transform: staging_orders (child span, 120s)
│   ├── dbt model: stg_orders (child span, 60s)
│   └── dbt model: stg_payments (child span, 55s)
├── Test: data_quality_checks (child span, 15s)
│   ├── test: unique_order_id (child span, 3s)
│   └── test: not_null_amount (child span, 2s)
└── Load: publish_to_warehouse (child span, 90s)
```

### Implementation

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Setup (once at pipeline entry point)
provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="otel-collector:4317")))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer("data-pipeline")

def run_pipeline():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("pipeline.daily_orders") as pipeline_span:
        pipeline_span.set_attribute("pipeline.run_id", run_id)
        pipeline_span.set_attribute("pipeline.trigger", "scheduled")

        with tracer.start_as_current_span("extract.source_a") as extract_span:
            rows = extract_source_a()
            extract_span.set_attribute("extract.row_count", rows)

        with tracer.start_as_current_span("transform.staging") as transform_span:
            result = run_dbt_models()
            transform_span.set_attribute("transform.models_run", result.model_count)
            transform_span.set_attribute("transform.tests_passed", result.tests_passed)

        with tracer.start_as_current_span("load.publish") as load_span:
            written = publish_to_warehouse()
            load_span.set_attribute("load.rows_written", written)
```

### Span Attributes Convention

Use consistent attribute names across pipelines for queryability:

| Attribute | Example value | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `pipeline.name` | `daily_orders` | Identify the pipeline |
| `pipeline.run_id` | `run_2025-01-15T08:00:00` | Correlate all spans in one run |
| `pipeline.trigger` | `scheduled` / `manual` / `sensor` | How the run was initiated |
| `stage.type` | `extract` / `transform` / `test` / `load` | Pipeline phase |
| `stage.row_count` | `150000` | Rows processed in this stage |
| `stage.status` | `success` / `failed` / `skipped` | Outcome |
| `data.source` | `postgres.public.orders` | Source system and table |
| `data.target` | `snowflake.analytics.fct_orders` | Destination table |

## Best practices

- Instrument pipelines with health signals from day one — retrofitting observability is far more expensive
- Set freshness SLOs per table based on actual consumer requirements, not arbitrary thresholds
- Use dead letter tables instead of silently dropping bad records — you need to know what you are losing
- Run data quality tests as pipeline stages, not as separate out-of-band processes
- Track test results over time to detect flaky tests and quality regressions
- Model pipeline runs as OTel traces so you can query execution across stages in a single view
- Alert on trends (increasing duration, growing dead letter rate) not just hard failures
- Make all pipelines idempotent — re-runs should be safe by default
- Store row counts and execution metadata in a metrics table for historical comparison
- Use source freshness checks before running transformations to fail fast on stale inputs
- Correlate pipeline failures with infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, query queue depth)

## Anti-patterns

- Relying solely on pipeline success/failure status without checking data quality
- Monitoring only the final output table while ignoring intermediate stages
- Setting alerting thresholds so sensitive that alert fatigue causes real issues to be ignored
- Using `SELECT COUNT(*)` as the only data quality check — it catches volume problems but misses content issues
- Running data quality checks only in production, not in CI against development builds
- Treating zero-row results as successful when the pipeline "completed without errors"
- Building custom monitoring infrastructure instead of leveraging orchestrator-native signals
- Skipping idempotency because "we only run the pipeline once" — retries and backfills are inevitable
- Logging errors to files on ephemeral compute without forwarding to a persistent observability backend
- Ignoring schema drift until a downstream dashboard breaks
